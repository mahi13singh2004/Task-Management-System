This task management system is a simple command-line application built with Node.js. It allows users to add, remove, and view tasks saved in a JSON file (todolist.json). The add command adds a 
new task, the remove command deletes a task by its index, and the list command displays all tasks. The tasks are stored as objects in an array, with each object containing a task property. This 
system provides a quick and easy way to manage tasks directly from the terminal.
